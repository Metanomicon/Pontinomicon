term: NCR
definition: A non-conformance record (NCR) is an issue created to record an inconsistency between the rules and player behavior
---

The non-conformance record (NCR) is a strategy for “enforcing” game rules. Instead of attempting to enforce the rules by some specified authority role (always problematic), an alternative approach is to get the players to commit to a different strategy: if a player breaks the rules (for whatever reason) or observes another player breaking the rules then they SHOULD create an issue noting the fact, along with any relevant context. When the NCR is opened there should be no prejudice about whether breaking the rule is justified in this case. The issue should then trigger a discussion about whether the player should have followed the rules (and what was preventing them from doing so), or whether the rule itself requires refinement, exceptions, or possibly even repealing if it is not adding value.
