title: Existential Difference Operator
description: A __World State Operator__ which defines differences between __Objects__ existing between __World States__.
---

__Existential Difference__ between __World States__ relates to differences between __Objects__ existing. Given a __World State__ from Agent $$ A $$'s perspective where it has either 8 or 10 dollars, Existential Difference is defined as the minus ($$ - $$) operator, and results in $$ w_A(\$10) - w_A(\$8) = w_A(\$2) $$. A converse operator can be applied using addition ($$ + $$). 

Note that changes between __Objects__ can also be defined in terms of __Existential Difference__. The difference between a world with a brand new car and one where the same car is dilapidated can be expressed as subtraction of the new car, followed by immediate addition of the dilapidated one.
