title: World State
description:  Given that the __Information__ in an __Environment__ may change with respect to some parameter (for example, time), __World State__ defines a static snapshot of the __Information__ within an __Environment__. In other words, a __World State__ is an __Environment__ where all __Information__ is held constant. Denoted $$ w \in W $$. When used with a reference Agent, $$ w_A \in W_A $$, __World State__ refers to a static snapshot of an Agent's __World Model__ as opposed to the __World__ itself.

A __World State__ can be suffixed with descriptors which detail its properties. For example, a __World State__ containing $10 can be written as $$ w_A(\$10) $$.
